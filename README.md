Description
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages. This project covers the basics of CSS positioning and form styling, showcasing different ways to enhance the visual appearance and usability of web forms.

CSS Positioning
Static: Default positioning. Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow.
Relative: Elements are positioned relative to their normal position.
Absolute: Elements are positioned relative to their nearest positioned ancestor.
Fixed: Elements are positioned relative to the viewport and remain fixed when scrolling.
Sticky: Elements act like relative until a certain scroll point, after which they become fixed.
CSS Forms
Styling the appearance of form elements using CSS properties such as width, padding, border, and border-radius to enhance user experience.
